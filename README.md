======

Skopeo is a web-based playmat for the Microscope RPG which is available at http://lamemage.com/

Once the playmat is stable, APIs will be developed for thick client access.
Internal API design is required to support this usage.

Skopeo is one of the Ancient Greek roots of "microscope" - it roughly means to look at or around or examine.
